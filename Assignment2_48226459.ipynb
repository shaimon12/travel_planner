    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a **Personal Travel Assistant** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** that generates tailored multi-day travel itineraries based on user preferences. The assistant supports both **cloud-based (Gemini 1.5 Pro)** and **offline (TinyLLaMA 1.1B)** models, offering flexibility for connected and private environments. A full **Streamlit web app** was developed for real-time interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate and compare **Gemini** (online) and **TinyLLaMA** (offline) for itinerary generation  \n",
    "- Build an interactive **Streamlit** interface to collect user inputs and display results  \n",
    "- Dynamically construct prompts based on travel type, group size, dietary needs, etc.  \n",
    "- Evaluate both models across diverse, realistic travel scenarios  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools & Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLMs**: Gemini via Google API; TinyLLaMA via Hugging Face  \n",
    "- **Frontend**: Streamlit with input validation, translation, downloads  \n",
    "- **Backend**: Python with prompt engineering, model handling, and location matching  \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Manual testing using 5 unique user profiles and side-by-side model comparison  \n",

    "# 2. LLM Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we configured two types of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backend: a **cloud-based model** (Gemini 1.5 Pro) and a **local offline model** (TinyLLaMA 1.1B). This dual approach demonstrates both API integration and local deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud-Based Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "We accessed Gemini via Google’s `generativeai` API using a free API key from MakerSuite. The connection was successfully established, and the model was used to generate high-quality travel itineraries based on structured prompts.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Model: TinyLLaMA 1.1B\n",
    "\n",
    "To support offline use, we deployed TinyLLaMA using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The model runs locally on CPU or M1 (MPS backend) and generates responses without needing an internet connection.\n"

    "# Web App Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've developed and tested our itinerary generation logic in the notebook, we’ve implemented the entire workflow as a user-friendly **Streamlit web application**. This web app brings together all the features and models from the notebook into a real-time, interactive interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user flow is designed to be intuitive: the user first selects their **travel type** (e.g., solo, with family, or with friends), and based on this selection, the form dynamically reveals relevant group input fields such as the number of adults, children, or friends. Only then does the user complete the rest of the form to generate a personalized itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Added to the Web App (`travel_assistant.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project extends the Jupyter-based assistant into a full-featured **Streamlit web application**, capable of real-time itinerary planning using both **cloud-based and offline LLMs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Features:\n",
    "- **Gemini Integration (Online)**: Fast and well-structured itinerary generation via `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`.\n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA Integration (Offline)**: Lightweight, privacy-focused LLM with local inference (runs entirely on-device).\n",
    "- **Dynamic Travel Style Handling**: Users select a travel type first. If \"with family\" or \"with friends\" is selected, additional fields for number of adults, children, or friends appear immediately—*before* form submission.\n",
    "- **Dietary Preference Support**: Includes a multi-select option for dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian, halal, gluten-free), which influences food-related suggestions in the itinerary.\n",
    "- **Natural Dialogue Flow**: Captures all key user preferences: name, age, travel style, destination, duration, budget, interests, and dietary needs.\n",
    "- **Prompt Builder**: Dynamically constructs a context-aware prompt tailored to the user’s full input and sends it to both LLMs.\n",
    "- **City & Country Recognition**: Accepts both cities and countries as valid destinations using `geonamescache` and `pycountry`.\n",
    "- **Destination Type Detection**: Informs the user whether the provided destination was identified as a city or a country.\n",
    "- **Typo Handling for Destinations**: Automatically corrects common misspellings in destination names using `difflib`.\n",
    "- **Translation Support (Gemini only)**: Users can instantly translate the itinerary into several languages (e.g., Spanish, French, Arabic).\n",
    "- **Download Buttons**: Allows users to download the generated itinerary as a `.txt` file for offline access or sharing.\n",
    "- **Model Speed Comparison**: Shows generation time for both Gemini and TinyLLaMA to help compare performance.\n",
    "- **Offline Privacy Note**: Clearly communicates that TinyLLaMA runs locally and does not send any data to external servers.\n",
    "- **Input Validation**: Ensures users fill out all required fields before allowing itinerary generation.\n",

    "## Model Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gemini (Cloud-Based)\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Excellent handling of personalization, group context, and dietary needs  \n",
    "- Accurate geographic/cultural detail (e.g. halal spots in Melbourne, gluten-free options in Venice)  \n",
    "- Realistic pacing, budget tracking, and restaurant/activity suggestions  \n",
    "- Supports longer, structured itineraries (e.g., Chi’s 14-day Norway trip)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Dependent on internet + API key  \n",
    "- Slightly higher latency for longer prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### TinyLLaMA (Offline)\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Fully local and private  \n",
    "- Fast on-device generation (despite occasional longer times for longer prompts)  \n",
    "- Works well for basic, short itineraries (with general structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Repetitive phrasing  \n",
    "- Ignores dietary restrictions or misrepresents them  \n",
    "- Prone to hallucination (cities, dishes, places)  \n",
    "- Lacks coherent pacing or budget sensitivity  \n",
    "- Poor contextual continuity across days\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario-Based Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1 (Mia - Florence, High Budget, Dietary Needs)\n",
    "- **Gemini** gave a luxury, custom itinerary with dietary-friendly places.  \n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** went off-course, suggesting dairy-based items and ignoring Florence-specific detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2 (Chow - Barcelona, Family, Moderate Budget)\n",
    "- **Gemini** balanced cultural immersion with family pacing and cost-saving tips.  \n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** repeated itself and missed the \"with children\" nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3 (Ali - Melbourne, Friends, Low Budget, Halal)\n",
    "- **Gemini** shined with halal listings, apps, and authentic local flavor.  \n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** hallucinated locations in New Zealand and strayed from the brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 4 (Mark - Venice, Older Family, Dietary Needs)\n",
    "- **Gemini** again impressed with upscale food recs and mobility-friendly pacing.  \n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** misaligned meals and was vague on structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 5 (Chi - Norway, Solo, 14 Days, Low Budget)\n",
    "- **Gemini** created a fully structured itinerary with accurate transit, budget tips, and city flow.  \n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** hallucinated cities, timelines, and even dish names — significant failure case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation confirms that:\n",
    "- **Gemini** is highly capable for real-world, production-grade itinerary generation.\n",
    "- **TinyLLaMA** is best reserved for **offline, lightweight, fallback use** — but not suitable where accuracy, detail, or cultural context is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid systems could use **TinyLLaMA for offline drafts**, and **Gemini for refinement, personalization, or final rendering** in connected environments.\n"
